Data Structures & Programmatic Thinking
=======================================

https://slides.com/pepegar/dspt-2/live

Plan for this session
=====================

-   Learn about hardware
-   Install Anaconda
-   Try Spyder editor
-   *troubleshooting*
-   Break

Hardware: building blocks
=========================

Transistors
===========

Basic component of computers

 

No moving parts (solid state)

 

Controls current flow


Chips
=====

Millions of transistors grouped together

 

Moore\'s law

 

Pins make it possible to plug them to sockets


CPU
===

Brains of the computer

 

Moore\'s law debunked

 

More computing power is achieved through more cores

 

Speed measured in hertz


RAM
===

RAM is the short term memory of a computer

 

Think of it like a big shared blackboard

 

Divided in addresses

 

Not persistent

 

Fast


HDD / SSD
=========

Hard Disk Drives or Solid State Drives are the long term storage of the
computer

 

Persistent

 

Slower than RAM

 

Higher capacity than RAM


Motherboard
===========

The motherboard ties all hardware components together

 

Lets them communicate

 

RAM goes in the blue slots in the right, CPU in the black square socket


Operating System
================


Operating System
================

The OS is the most foundational program running in a computer

 

It controls the hardware and gives other programs running in the
computer access to hardware and resources

Installing Anaconda
===================

-   https://www.anaconda.com/download
-   Download the 3.7 version for your OS
-   Install it
-   Open \"Anaconda Navigator\"
-   Launch Spyder Editor

Trying Spyder
=============

Spyder is the text editor we\'re going to use to develop our Python
programs

Trying Spyder
=============

Download the \"try\_spyder.py\" file from the course files folder

Break!
