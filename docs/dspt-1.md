Programming languages
=====================

Throughout this course we will use Python as our programming language,
but there are many more!


Programming languages
=====================

  Language     Paradigm          Execution     Purpose
  ------------ ----------------- ------------- ----------
  Python       imperative        interpreted   general
  Java         object oriented   compiled      general
  Javascript   imperative        interpreted   general
  Haskell      functional        compiled      general
  SQL          declarative       interpreted   specific
  HTML         declarative       interpreted   specific

Programming languages
=====================

## Python

Python is one of the most used languages right now.  Its applications
range from Data Science to Web servers

Programming languages
=====================

## Java

Java is a very famous language developed by Oracle in the 90s, mostly
used in enterprise software.

Programming languages
=====================

How do we write code?
---------------------

Coding is basically putting words together following a programming
language specification.


Programming languages
=====================

How do we write code?
---------------------

We can put these words directly in a text file and let then execute it
as a program


Programming languages
=====================

How do we write code?
---------------------

Or we can feed these words directly into the programming language
console


How do we code?
===============

Using Python console

What is a program?
==================

[A program is a piece of software with a specific
task.]{style="font-size:0.9em"}

 

[This task can be something BIG, like handling a nuclear reactor, or
something small like Ctrl-c/Ctrl-v.]{style="font-size:0.9em"}

 

[There are two main components of programs, algorithms & data
structures.]{style="font-size:0.9em"}

What is an algorithm?
=====================

An algorithm is a sequence of steps that guide the computer in how to
solve a problem

What\'s wrong with this algorithm? why did Wolowitz needed to fix it?

There was an infinite loop, a **bug**

[What is a data structure?]{style="font-size:0.9em"}
====================================================

Data structures are collections of values, relationships between them,
and operations that can work on them
