Data Structures & Programmatic Thinking
=======================================


Plan for this session
=====================

-   Learn about handling files

Reading files
=============

```python
file = open("file_path")

for line in file:
    #do something with line
    pass
```

Reading files
=============

-   create a text file
-   read all its lines

Interlude: with
===============

Every time we use files we need to **close()** the file after use.  Not
closing the file would end up in an unexpected program crash.

```python
fh = open("file.txt")
# do whatever with the file here
fh.close()
```

Interlude: with
===============

Rewriting our previous example to use **with**

Interlude: with
===============

In order to avoid this, Python provides the **with** keyword.  Whatever
we pass to **with** will be closed after the body.

```python
with open("file.txt") as fh:
    pass # do whatever with the file
```

Writing files
=============

We can write to files using a similar approach

```python
with open("file.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write("this content will be written to the file!")
```

Writing files. modes
====================


When opening a file, we can choose in which **mode** we open it

CSV files
=========

Python comes with a **CSV** library that we can use out of the box.  We
use it by **importing** it.  **Imports** are commonly added at the top
of the file.

```python
import csv
```

CSV files
=========

The **csv** library is based on the idea of readers and writers.  One
can read all lines in a file like so:

```python
with open("file.csv") as f:
    reader = csv.reader(f)
    for line in reader:
        print(line)  #line will be a list here 
```

first we open the file normally

Then we create a reader using **csv.reader()**

Finally, we operate with the reader

CSV files
=========

writing is not very different from reading:

```python
lines = [
  ["asdf", "qwer"],
  ["hello", "world"]
]

with open("file.csv", "a") as f:
    writer = csv.writer(f)
    for line in lines:
        writer.writerow(line)
```

First we need some data to put in the csv file

Then we open the file with the append mode

Later, we create a **csv.writer**

Finally, we can use the **writer.writerow()** method to add stuff to the
file

CSV files. Dictionaries
=======================

We can use specific writers for dictionaries!

```python
beatles = [
    {"name": "John", "instrument": "voice"},
    {"name": "Paul", "instrument": "guitar"},
    {"name": "George", "instrument": "bass"},
    {"name": "Ringo", "instrument": "drums"}
]

with open("beatles.csv", "w") as my_file:
    writer = csv.DictWriter(my_file, ["name", "instrument"])
    writer.writeheader()
    for beatle in beatles:
        writer.writerow(beatle)
```

First we need some data to put in the csv file

Then we open the file with the append mode

Later, we create a **csv.DictWriter**

Finally, we can use the **writer.writerow()** or
**writer.writeheader()** method to add stuff

CSV files. Dictionaries
=======================

We can use specific readers too

```python
with open("beatles.csv") as my_file:
    reader = csv.DictReader(my_file)
    for beatle in reader:
        print(beatle["name"] + " -> " + beatle["instrument"])
```

Then we open the file with the read mode (default)

Later, we create a **csv.DictReader**

Each element in the reader will be a dictionary already

Exercises
=========

```python
1. Without using the csv library, create a function named 
   parse for converting from CSV to a lists of lists.
  
2. Without using the csv library, create a function named
   to_csv for converting that list of lists to CSV.
```
