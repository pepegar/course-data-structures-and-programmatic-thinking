# Session 5

In this async session we will learn about functions and then we will
have some exercises to do in order to put in practice all stuff we
have learnt so far.

There is a [forum
open](https://campus.ie.edu/webapps/discussionboard/do/forum?action=list_threads&course_id=_114334206_1&nav=discussion_board_entry&conf_id=_255760_1&forum_id=_120248_1)
in Campus, if you feel stuck with anything and would like to get some
help, please post there.  I will check in several times during the day
to answer questions that may pop.  Please, also consider that I will
prioritize questions in the forum before questions you send directly
to my email.

Finally, please send over to my email your solutions to the exercises
using a subject line like follows:

```
Solutions exercise 5 - <name_and_last_name>
```

Where **name_and_last_name** is your... well... name and last name :) If I
had to send it i'd do it with a subject line like this:

```
Solutions exercise 5 - Pepe Garc√≠a
```

# Functions

Functions are groups of Python statements that have a name and can be
executed on demand.  They will behave as black boxes to which we will
be able to pass data in the form of **parameters** and that will give
us output in the form of **return values**.

## Calling functions

The syntax for calling functions is the following:

~~~ {.python .numberLines startFrom="1" caption="function calls"}
function_name(parameter1, parameter2, parameterN)
~~~

When naming functions we will need to apply the same naming rules as
for variables.

We have already seen some functions, such as **print()**, **type()**,
**str()**, etc.  Notice that we have used all these functions by
passing only one argument, but there are others to which we can pass
more than one argument.

## Declaring functions

We can declare our own functions using the **def** keyword with the
following syntax:

~~~ {#mycode .python .numberLines startFrom="1" caption="function declaration"}
def function_name(parameter1, parameter2):
    #<body>
~~~

When creating a function we need to indent the body to tell Python
what piece of code we want to include inside the function, as we did
with **if** statements.

## Returning values from functions

Functions in Python can return values after doing all the operations
they perform.

## Function Parameters

Parameters are values that are injected to the function body when we
call it

## Exercises

### exercise 1

Create a function `weekly_commute_time` that asks the user their daily
commute time and returns their weekly time spent commuting.

### exercise 2

What do the following expressions return?

- `True or 11 > 34`
- `False and (1 == 1)`
- `(77 // 11) > 6 and False`

### exercise 3

Create a function `area_triangle` that takes the base and height of a
triangle and returns its area

### exercise 4

Create function `area_triangle_rectangle` that takes the base, height,
and the kind of shape and calculates its area.  It should work for
both triangles and rectangles.

### exercise 5

Create a function `im_in_love` that takes a weekday number (from
monday to friday), and returns how that weekday is (according to The
Cure!):

```
I don't care if Monday's blue
Tuesday's grey and Wednesday too
Thursday I don't care about you
It's Friday, I'm in love
```
