# Session 3

Welcome to the first async session.  In this session you will learn
somethign new about Python and you will need to apply everything we've
learnt so far to solve some exercises.

Doing all this work is **compulsory**.  We will review the exercises
together in class the next sync session.

There will be a forum open in case you have questions.  You will be
able to ask questions there, and answer questions by your peers if you
find you can help them.  I will check the forum several times during
the day in order to provide answers to questions.

Finally, it's not mandatory to write messages in the forum, if you
find you don't need any help and everything is clear, just do the
exercises and wait for the next sync session to check your solutions.

## User input

There is a handy function **input()** that allows us to capture input
from the user

```python
name = input("Tell me your name: ")

print("hello, " + name)
```

Something that you need to bear in mind is that `input` always returns
a string.


# Exercises


1. Create a program that calculates the total number of seconds in an hour
   and prints it afterwards.

2. How does the following expression evaluate?
   `2 + (3 + 4) + (5 * 33 ** 34)`

3. Create a program that asks the user for their age and their mother's
   age and calculate the age difference

4. Make the following expressions work (use Python console for this one)

```
         3 + "3"
         'there are ' + 4 ' dogs barking'
```

5. Create a program that asks the user for their hourly wage and
   prints the total **weekly** and **monthly** wage.  (assuming 8h
   a day and 20 days a month of work).
