Throughout this course we will use Python as our programming language,
but there are many more!

## Programming languages

| Language   | Paradigm        | Execution   | Purpose |
|------------|-----------------|-------------|---------|
| Python     | imperative      | interpreted | general |
| Java       | object oriented | compiled    | general |
| Javascript | imperative      | interpreted | general |
| Haskell    | functional      | compiled    | general |
| SQL        | declarative     | interpreted | specifi |
| HTML       | declarative     | interpreted | specifi |

### Python

Python is one of the most used languages right now.  Its applications
range from Data Science to Web servers

### Java

Java is a very famous language developed by Oracle in the 90s, mostly
used in enterprise software.

How do we write code?
---------------------

Coding is basically putting words together following a programming
language specification.

We can put these words directly in a text file and let then execute it
as a program

Or we can feed these words directly into the programming language
console


How do we code?
===============

<!-- TODO: open console, create -->
Using Python console

What is a program?
==================

A program is a piece of software with a specific
task.

This task can be something BIG, like handling a nuclear reactor, or
something small like Ctrl-c/Ctrl-v.

There are two main components of programs, algorithms & data
structures.

What is an algorithm?
=====================

An algorithm is a sequence of steps that guide the computer in how to
solve a problem

What\'s wrong with this algorithm? why did Wolowitz needed to fix it?

There was an infinite loop, a **bug**

[What is a data structure?]{style="font-size:0.9em"}
====================================================

Data structures are collections of values, relationships between them,
and operations that can work on them
