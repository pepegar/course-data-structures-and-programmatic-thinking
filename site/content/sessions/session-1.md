Data Structures and Programmatic Thinking is an introductory course to learn
about programming. If you've programmed before, that's great! if you haven't,
that's great too, we'll start from the beginning.

## About the course

We'll have 15 sessions in total in the course, **13 of them will be lectures**,
**1 of them, a workgroup session**, and the last session we'll have the **final
exam**.

## Evaluation method

We'll evaluate using the following formula

- Individual work: 30%
- Final exam: 20%
- Class participation: 20%
- Workgroups: 30%

For individual work, we'll post an individual assignment in campus around the
second week, and you'll have one full week to handle it before the deadline.


## Learning Objectives

- Learn What's programming
- Understand data structures
- Understand how computers execute programs
- Learn the basics of Python

## Session structure

- Lecture \~50 mins
- Guided exercises \~30 mins

## Plan for today

- Learn about software
- Understand what are algorithms
- Understand what are data structures

Throughout this course we will use Python as our programming language,
but there are many more!

## Programming languages

First of all, we need to understand what's a programming language. A programming
langage is just a set of instructions that one can use to communicate with a
computer.

Programmign languages can vary a lot from one another, they may have different
purposes, different ways of writing programs in them, they may be closer to
natural languages such as english or farther.

{{% marginnote %}} As you can see in this table, there are a lot of different other programming languages, and we use these features to categorize them. {{% /marginnote %}}

| Language   | Paradigm        | Execution   | Purpose  |
|------------|-----------------|-------------|----------|
| Python     | imperative      | interpreted | general  |
| Java       | object oriented | compiled    | general  |
| Javascript | imperative      | interpreted | general  |
| Haskell    | functional      | compiled    | general  |
| SQL        | declarative     | interpreted | specific |
| HTML       | declarative     | interpreted | specific |

The language we're going to learn in this course is Python.

### Python

Python is one of the most used languages right now.  Its applications range from
Data Science to Web servers. Python is **very simple** to use, but also very
powerful.  Here you can see the simplest Python program:

```python
print("Hello, world!")
```


## How do we write code?

Coding is basically putting words together following a programming language
specification. We can put these words directly in a text file and let then
execute it as a program, or we can feed these words directly into the
programming language console.

### Using the Python console

In order to open the Python console, you can open a terminal (Terminal.app in
MacOS) and directly type `python` once it opens. If we hit enter, we'll be
dropped into a screen similar to this one:

```
$ python
Python 3.7.5 (default, Oct 14 2019, 23:08:55) 
[GCC 8.3.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> 
```

We can start typing Python code right away.  Try our previous program!

## What is a program?

A program is a piece of software with a specific
task.

This task can be something BIG, like handling a nuclear reactor, or
something small like Ctrl-c/Ctrl-v.

There are two main components of programs, algorithms & data
structures.

## What is an algorithm?

An algorithm is a sequence of steps that guide the computer in how to
solve a problem


## Algorithms


What\'s wrong with this algorithm? why did Wolowitz needed to fix it?

There was an infinite loop, a **bug**


## What happens when an algorithm doesn't work correctly?

## What is a data structure?

Data structures are collections of values, relationships between them,
and operations that can work on them
